The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate statistical methodology that minimises bias in risk prediction. 

The primary aim is to assess the predictive contribution of risk factors, focusing on protected characteristics, within a given data-driven program.

The remainder of this analysis will try to identify variables that lead to poor calibration and predictive performance. Counterfactual predictions are employed to help decounfound and improve the accuracy of risk prediction models.
